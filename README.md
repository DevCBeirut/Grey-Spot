> A social good is something that benefits the largest number of people in the largest possible way, such as clean air, clean water, healthcare and literacy. Also known as "common good," social good can trace its history to Ancient Greece philosophers and implies a positive impact on individuals or society in general. It also provides the basis for charity or philanthropic work.
